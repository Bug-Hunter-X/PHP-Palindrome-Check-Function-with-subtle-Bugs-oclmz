# PHP Palindrome Check Function with subtle Bugs

This repository demonstrates a common, subtle bug in a PHP function designed to check if a string is a palindrome. The function incorrectly handles strings with spaces, case-sensitive characters, and lacks proper handling for edge cases such as empty strings or single-character strings.  The solution demonstrates how to correct these issues to ensure robust palindrome detection.

## Bug Description
The original `isPalindrome` function fails to correctly identify palindromes that include spaces or uppercase letters.  It also returns unexpected results for empty or single-character strings. This is a classic example of how seemingly minor oversights can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The improved `isPalindrome` function in `bugSolution.php` addresses these shortcomings by carefully handling spaces, case sensitivity, and edge cases to ensure accurate and reliable palindrome detection.
